Small scanf implementation.

Python has powerful regular expressions, but sometimes they are totally overkill
when you just want to parse a simple-formatted string.
C programmers use the scanf-function for these tasks (see link below).

This implementation of scanf translates the simple scanf-format into
regular expressions. Unlike C you can be sure that there are no buffer overflows
possible.

For more information see
  * http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/node49.html
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanf

Original code from:
    http://code.activestate.com/recipes/502213-simple-scanf-implementation/

Modified original to make the %f more robust, as well as added %* modifier to
skip fields.

    scanf supports the following formats:
      %c        One character
      %5c       5 characters
      %d, %i    int value
      %7d, %7i  int value with length 7
      %f        float value
      %o        octal value
      %X, %x    hex value
      %s        string terminated by whitespace

    Any pattern with a * after the % (e.g., '%*f') will result in scanf matching the pattern but omitting the matched
    portion from the results. This is helpful when parts of the input string may change but should be ignored.

    Examples:

    >>> scanf("%s - %d errors, %d warnings", "/usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 4 warnings")
    ('/usr/sbin/sendmail', 0, 4)
    >>> scanf("%o %x %d", "0123 0x123 123")
    (83, 291, 123)
    >>> scanf("%o %*x %d", "0123 0x123 123")
    (83, 123)

    :param format_str: the scanf-compatible format string comprised of plain text and tokens from the table above.
    :param line: the text line to be parsed.
    :param collapse_whitespace: if True, performs a greedy match with whitespace in the input string,
    allowing for easy parsing of text that has been formatted to be read more easily. This enables better matching
    in log files where the data has been formatted for easier reading. These cases have variable amounts of whitespace
    between the columns, depending on the number of characters in the data itself.
    :return: a tuple of found values or None if the format does not match.
